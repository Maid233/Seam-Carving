# Seam Carving

Seam Carving algorithm implement based on C++ and OpenCV. 
This is a modified version of my previous work (cooperated with others, https://github.com/Meidozuki/SeamCarve2022Spring).

## Dependencies

- CMake
- OpenCV

## Build

``` bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
.\SeamCarver
```

## Usage

Input the file path of the image (e.g. test_image/HJoceanSmall.png) or you can also do nothing to use the default image :)

Then choose mod to edit image, some may need you to input the number of seams.
